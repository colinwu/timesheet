Timesheet is a Ruby on Rails (3.1.0) application that lets you keep track of the time you spend on various projects.

The "home" page is the project list (index action). From this list you can
* click on project name to edit it's details

* click on "Events" link (button?) to show (complete) list of events associated with a project

* click on "Start" link (button?) to start a new event for a project
** timestamp defaults to now
** rate defaults to project's rate
** description field is required

* click on "Stop" link (button?) to stop the (only) started event
** end_at defaults to now but can be changed
** description field can be updated

* click on "New Invoice" link (button?) to create an invoice
** list only unpaid, completed (i.e. both start and end times present) events
** checkbox for each event selects it for inclusion in invoice
